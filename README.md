## What it does

These days, setting up build chains for frontend projects requires lots of knowledge and quite some time. Especially when developing libraries for the **Angular ecosystem**, there is a fair amount of things to do in order to get an Angular library published just right.

The **Angular Package Builder** is here to help. Once configured, this NodeJS-based command line tool will build your Angular library with a single command, allowing developers to focus on the important things - developing!

Under the hood, the **Angular Package Builder** will:

- inline (and compile) external resources (HTML, CSS, SASS)
- compile TypeScript sources into JavaScript (ES2015, ES5)
- create JavaScript bundles (ESM2015, ESM5, UMD)

> Please note that the **Angular Package Builder** only builds libraries for **Angular 5+**. Previous Angular versions are not supported.

## How to install

You can get **angular-package-builder** via **npm** by either adding it as a new devDependency to your `package.json` file and running
`npm install`, or running the following command:

``` bash
npm install angular-package-builder --save-dev
```

### Requirements

- **angular-package-builder** requires at least **NodeJS 7.6** (or higher). *Earlier 7.x versions of NodeJS (7.0 to 7.5) might also work when
executing **angular-package-builder** using the `--harmony-async-await` flag.*

- **angular-package-builder** requires all its peer dependencies (*@angular/compiler-cli*, *@angular-compiler*, *typescript*) to be installed in the compatible versions (see the *package.json* file for more details).

<br><br>

## How to use

In most cases, integrating **angular-package-builder** into a project is very straightforward. First, make sure to call **angular-package-builder** within one of the scripts of your `package.json` file. For instance:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "builder": "angular-package-builder"
  }
}
```

Then, create a `.angular-package.json` file in your project's root folder, and fill it with the following content (using your custom configuration values, of course):

``` json
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/angular-package-builder/angular-package.schema.json",
  "entryFile": "lib/src/index.ts",
  "outDir": "dist"
}
```

Finally, reference your build output by adding the following to your `package.json` (changing file names and paths based on your project and its configuration):

``` json
{
  "typings": "./my-library.d.ts",
  "main": "./bundles/my-library.umd.js",
  "module": "./esm5/my-library.js",
  "es2015": "./esm2015/my-library.js","
}
```

> The **Angular Package Builder** only builds libraries from an Angular / JavaScript perspective. It's possible that you might have to setup a few extra build steps, for instance in order to compile global SASS, or copy assets / other files.

<br>

### Advanced configuration

Usually, the configuration described above should be working for most library projects. For special use cases, or more advanced configuration, you can extend your `.angular-package.json` file further.

#### TypeScript compiler options

One of the things you might want to configure specifically for your project is TypeScript. Popular options include `strictNullChecks`, `skipLibCheck` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`. For instance:

``` json
{
  "typescriptCompilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

See the **[TypeScript Compiler Options Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)** for the full list of available options.

> The following options cannot be changed: `declaration`, `emitDecoratorMetadata`, `experimentalDecorators`, `module`, `moduleResolution`, `newLine`, `outDir`, `rootDir`, `sourceRoot` and `target`.

#### Angular compiler options

Furthermore, you might also decide to configure the Angular compiler. Common options are `annotateForClosureCompiler`, `preserveWhitespaces` and `strictMetadataEmit`.

``` json
{
  "angularCompilerOptions": {
    "annotateForClosureCompiler": false
  }
}
```

> The following options cannot be changed: `flatModuleId`, `flatModuleOutFile and `skipTemplateCodegen`.

#### Dependency declaration

By default, the **Angular Package Builder** will identify your libraries' dependencies automatically. If, for some reason, a dependency is missing or you want to overwrite a dependency definition, you can declare them as `dependency package name` -> `global constant`.

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@ngx-translate/core": "ngxTranslate.core"
  }
}
```

<br>

### CLI commands

Usually, simply calling `angular-package-builder` in your npm scripts should work like a charm. There are, however, two parameters which can be defined:

- `--config <PATH>` allows you to define a custom path to your `.angular-package.json` file
- `--debug` emits the output of intermediate build steps to the disk (`dist-angular-package-builder`)

> You can always run `angular-package-builder --help` to get a full list of available command line parameters.

## Known pitfalls and solutions

There are quite a few pitfalls one might run into when packaging an Angular library. Many of them are everything but obvious, and the fix is not always clear. The following is a collection of known pitfally and tips on how to solve them.

> Feel free to extend this list by creating an issue / opening a Pull Request!

<br>

### Caution with barrels

Usually, libraries expose their functionality in the form of a single import source (e.g. the module name). Internally, this is achieved by re-exporting this functionality within a so-called **[Barrel](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#barrel)**, a `index.ts` file.

This very common technique works like a charm for the top barrel / `index.ts` file. However, issues *might* occur when - somewhere in the dependency tree - two barrels meet each other. Funnily enough, in those cases the Angular Package Builder will probably succeed, and even the compilation output will look like it is correct - but actually is not. The issue becomes appearant when trying to import the library into an Angular application (an error will be thrown, e.g. "dependencies cannot be resolved").

**Therefore: We recommend to only use a single barrel / `index.ts` file at the top of you library, re-exporting all public functionality from that place.**

<br>

### Forbidden JSDoc tags

When building a library with the `annotateForClosureCompiler` option being enabled (which it is by default), not all JSDoc tags are allowed. In particular, any tag which describes the type of classes, methods or variables is unnecessary because redundant (the TypeScript code already provides this kind of information). If any of those tags are being used anyway, the Angular Compiler (`tsickle` to be specific) will complain. The list of forbidden tags include:

- types in parameter tags (e.g. `@param {string} myOption - My option`)
- type tags on variables (e.g. `@type {string}`)
- annotations such as `@constructor` or `@class`.

> The full list of alled JSDoc tags can be found **[in the tsickle source files](https://github.com/angular/tsickle/blob/d24b139b71a3f86bf25d6eecf4d4dcdad3b379e4/src/jsdoc.ts#L48)**.

**Therefore: Remove all redundant JSDoc tags until the Angular Compiler is happy.** Alternatively, you could also disabled the `annotateForClosureCompiler` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` - but we don't recommend it :)
