## What it does

These days, setting up build chains for frontend projects requires lots of knowledge and time. When working with Angular, in particular, there is a fair amount of things to do in order to get an Angular library published just right.

The **Angular Package Builder** is here to help! Once set up, this NodeJS-based command line tool will build your Angular libraries with a single command, allowing developers to focus on the important things - developing!

Features include:

- :pushpin: Support for primary and (multiple) secondary entry points
- :gift: Support for multiple libraries (e.g. in a monorepo)
- :page_facing_up: Inlining of external resources, such as templates (HTML) and styles (CSS, SASS)
- :hammer: Custom configurations (Angular compiler options, TypeScipt compiler options, external dependencies)

The result is a package, following the official **[Angular Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview)**:

- :green_book: JavaScript build (ES2015, ES5) & bundles (ES2015, ES5, UMD)
- :blue_book: TypeScript type definition files
- :closed_book: Angular AoT metadata file
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: `package.json` file, pointing to entry files

## How to install

You can get the **angular-package-builder** via **npm** by adding it as a new *devDependency* to your `package.json` file and running
`npm install`. Alternatively, run the following command:

``` bash
npm install angular-package-builder --save-dev
```

<br>

### Angular compatibility

The following lists the Angular versions supported by the **Angular Package Builder**. The table also mentions the TypeScript and RxJS
versions which are officially supported by each Angular version. Diverging from this matrix is surely possible yet might lead to
unexpected issues. The last column defines the minimal required NodeJS version.

| Angular                                 | TypeScript              | RxJS  | NodeJS     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `4.0.x` `4.1.x` `4.2.x` `4.3.x` `4.4.x` | `2.1.x` `2.2.x` `2.3.x` | `5.x` | `>= 7.6.0` |
| `5.0.x`                                 | `2.4.x`                 | `5.x` | `>= 7.6.0` |
| `5.1.x`                                 | `2.4.x` `2.5.x`         | `5.x` | `>= 7.6.0` |
| `5.2.x`                                 | `2.4.x` `2.5.x` `2.6.x` | `5.x` | `>= 7.6.0` |
| `6.0.x`                                 | `2.7.x`                 | `6.x` | `>= 8.0.0` |

> Angular 2 is not supported. Angular versions newer than `6.0.x` might work, yet have not not been tested.

## How to use

In most cases, integrating **angular-package-builder** into a project is very straightforward.

> The **Angular Package Builder** only builds libraries from an Angular / JavaScript perspective. It's possible that you might have to setup
> a few extra build steps, for instance in order to compile global SASS, or copy assets / other files.

<br>

### Step 1: Create `.angular-package.json` file

Now, every library requires a `.angular-package.json` file to be present, placed directly next to the `package.json` file of that library.
Within that `.angular-package.json` file, you can place the build onfiguration for your library.

A minimal configuration looks like the following:

``` json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/angular-package-builder/angular-package.schema.json",
  "entryFile": "./index.ts",
  "outDir": "./dist"
}
```

The two options seen above are also the only required ones:

- `entryFile` is the relative path to the primary entry file
  - Usually, entry files are named `index.ts`
  - All further files of the library must be within the same folder, or some place deeper in the directory
- `outDir` is the relative path to the build output folder
  - Usually, the build output folder is named `dist`
  - Don't forget to add the `outDir` path to your `.gitignore` file

The following directory structure is recommended:

``` javascript
- dist/...               // Output
- src/...                // Source
- .angular-package.json  // Build config
- index.ts               // Entry file
- package.json           // Package
```

<br>

### Step 2: Add build script to `package.json`

Now, run **angular-package-builder** within one of your `package.json` scripts. The command accepts an unordered list of paths to
`.angular-package.json` files as parameters. For instance:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "angular-package-builder ./my-library/.angular-package.json"
  }
}
```

Packaging your library is now as simple as:

``` bash
npm run build
```

<br>

### Addition: Building multiple entry points

Angular, for instance, has packages with multiple entry points: `@angular/core` as the primary, and `@angular/core/testing` as the (here
only) secondary. Within the `.angular-package.json` file, you can define any number of secondary entry points using the `secondaryEntries`
option. For instance:

``` json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/angular-package-builder/angular-package.schema.json",
  "entryFile": "./index.ts",
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "secondaryEntries": [
    {
      "entryFile": "./testing/index.ts"
    }
  ]
}
```

> No change in the build script required!

<br>

### Addition: Building multiple libraries

Angular, again, consists of multiple packages, all united in a single Git repository (called monorepo). The **Angular Package Builder** is
able to build multiple libraries using a single command. Building more libraries means adding more `.angular-package.json` files to the
corresponding npm script. For example:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "angular-package-builder ./lib-one/.angular-package.json ./lib-two/.angular-package.json"
  }
}
```

> The order of the parameters does not matter as the **Angular Package Builder** will derive the build order independently.

<br><br><br>

## Advanced configuration

Usually, configuring the `entryFile` and `outDir` should be sufficient for most libraries. For more advanced use cases or requirements, you
can extend the build configuration in your `.angular-package.json` file(s).

<br>

### TypeScript compiler options

One of the things you might want to configure specifically for your project is TypeScript. Popular options include `strictNullChecks`,
`skipLibCheck` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`. For instance:

``` json
{
  "typescriptCompilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

See the **[TypeScript Compiler Options Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)** for the full
list of available options.

> The following options cannot be changed:<br>
> `declaration`, `emitDecoratorMetadata`, `experimentalDecorators`, `module`, `moduleResolution`, `newLine`, `outDir`, `rootDir`,
> `sourceRoot` and `target`

<br>

### Angular compiler options

Furthermore, you might also decide to configure the Angular compiler differently. Common options are `annotateForClosureCompiler`,
`preserveWhitespaces` and `strictMetadataEmit`. For instance:

``` json
{
  "angularCompilerOptions": {
    "annotateForClosureCompiler": false
  }
}
```

> The following options cannot be changed:<br>
> `flatModuleId`, `flatModuleOutFile` and `skipTemplateCodegen`

<br>

### Dependencies

By default, the **Angular Package Builder** will identify your libraries' dependencies automatically. If, for some reason, a dependency is
missing or you want to overwrite a dependency definition, you can declare them in the form of `package -> global constant`. For instance:

``` json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@ngx-translate/core": "ngxTranslate.core"
  }
}
```

<br><br><br>

## Known pitfalls with solutions

There are quite a few pitfalls when packaging an Angular library. Most of them are all but obvious, and the fix is not always clear. The following is a collection of known pitfally, plus tips on how to solve them.

> Feel free to extend this list by **[creating an issue](https://github.com/dominique-mueller/angular-package-builder/issues/new)**!

<br>

### Caution with barrels

Usually, libraries are built in a way which allows them to be imported by a single import source (normalle the name of the module / package). This can be achieved by re-exporting the implementation (spread accross multiple files) with a so-called **[Barrel](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#barrel)**, in other word an `index.ts` file.

While this very common technique works like a charm for the top barrel, *issues might occur when - somewhere within the library - two barrels meet each other*. Funnily enough, should such a constellation lead to any issues, it won't be appeatant right away; chances are good that the Angular Package Builder will succeed, and the compilation output will probably look correct. However, when trying to import the library into an Angular application later on,an error will be thrown (e.g. "injected dependencies cannot be resolved").

#### Solution

We recommend to only use a single barrel / `index.ts` file at the root of you library, re-exporting all public functionality from that place.

<br>

### Forbidden JSDoc tags

When building a library with the `annotateForClosureCompiler` option enabled - which it is by default - not all JSDoc tags are allowed. In particular, any tag which describes the type of classes, methods or variables is not allowed because redundant (the TypeScript code already contains this kind of information). If any of those tags are being used anyway, the Angular Compiler (`tsickle` to be specific) will complain. The list of forbidden tags include:

- types in parameters (e.g. `@param {string} myOption`)
- type tags on variables (e.g. `@type {string}`)
- class or function tags such as `@constructor` or `@class`.

> The full list of allowed JSDoc tags can be found **[in the tsickle source](https://github.com/angular/tsickle/blob/d24b139b71a3f86bf25d6eecf4d4dcdad3b379e4/src/jsdoc.ts#L48)**.

``` text
ERROR: An error occured while trying to compile the TypeScript sources using the Angular Compiler.
       [tsickle] XXX: warning TS0: the type annotation on @param is redundant with its TypeScript type,
                 remove the {...} part
```

#### Solution

Preferably, remove all redundant JSDoc tags until the Angular Compiler is happy. As an alternative, you could also set the `annotateForClosureCompiler` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` to `false` - but we don't recommend it.

> For bigger libraries, removing those JSDoc tags manually is quite a paint and might actually take a very long time. We recommend an IDE or code editor with a search-and-replace functionality that can work with regular expressions to speed up this process (e.g. **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**).

<br>

### Metadata validation errors

If your library contains custom validators or utilities, you might run into an issue where - at compilation time - the `Angular Compiler CLI` throws an error while validating the generated `metadata.json` file. In particular, the error occurs when using closures (e.g. arrow functions) within static class methods.

``` text
ERROR: An error occured while trying to compile the TypeScript sources using the Angular Compiler.
       [TypeScript] Error: XXX Error encountered in metadata generated for exported symbol XXX
       [TypeScript] XXX Metadata collected contains an error that will be reported at runtime: Function
                    calls are not supported. Consider replacing the function or lambda with a reference
                    to an exported function.
       [TypeScript] {"__symbolic":"error","message":"Function call not supported","line":XX,"character":XX}
```

#### Solution

There are two ways to solve this issue:

- The preferred solution is to add the `@dynamic` tag to the comment describing the static method (or, if this should not work, the class containing the static method). Then, the Angular Compiler will make an exception for this code.
- The alternative way is to set the `strictMetadataEmit` option in the `angularCompilerOptions` object to `false`. Then, however, other metadata validation issues will no longer be visible.

> For more information on this issue and its solutions, see **[this Angular GitHub issue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/19698)**.

<br>

### Synthetic imports

Often, we integrate long-existing libraries into our Angular projects. **[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)**, for example, is one of the
libraries often used when working with dates. Due to its age, it's published as a single-entry ES5 module - which means people usually write
the following TypeScript code to import Moment.js into a file:

``` typescript
import * as moment from 'moment';
```

When trying to package an Angular library using the import statement above, an error will be thrown. In particular:

``` text
ERROR: Error: Cannot call a namespace ('moment')
```

#### Solution

The solution to this problem is called **[synthetic default imports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)**,
a technique which does allow TypeScript to make default import from modules that come without a default export.

First, enable synthetic default import support in the TypeScript configuration by adding the following line to the
`typescriptCompilerOptions` within your `.angular-package.json` file:

``` json
"typescriptCompilerOptions": {
  "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
}
```

Then, change the affected import statements to default import statements. For instance:

``` typescript
import moment from 'moment';
```
